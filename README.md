### A PHP autocomplete for [Brackets](https://brackets.io) 

With this plugin you will be able to auto insert local variables, attributes and methods from the hierarchical tree,
constants, defined functions, namespaces, classes, interfaces, etc...

Yes, I mean a full and robust autocomplete code for PHP on Brackets.

### Install

To install you can download it as a zip file (here in that 'clone or download' green button, over there).
But we **strongly** recommend you to install on the Brackets following:

`File menu` > `Extension Manager...` > `Available` > `Search input field` > **Type for** `php completion`

It will download and also manage updates.
